# Spa Graphing Guide for Home Assistant

This guide will help you set up beautiful graphs and analytics for your ESPHome Balboa Spa system in Home Assistant.

## üìä Available Dashboard Configurations

We provide two dashboard configurations for different needs:

### 1. Simple Graphs Dashboard (`spa-dashboard-simple-graphs.yaml`)
- **Best for**: Quick setup, minimal dependencies
- **Uses**: Built-in Home Assistant `history-graph` cards
- **Custom Cards Required**: Only `mushroom-template-card` and `card-mod`
- **Features**: Basic historical data visualization

### 2. Advanced Graphs Dashboard (`spa-dashboard-with-graphs.yaml`)
- **Best for**: Professional analytics, detailed insights
- **Uses**: `mini-graph-card` for advanced charting
- **Custom Cards Required**: `mushroom-template-card`, `card-mod`, and `mini-graph-card`
- **Features**: Interactive charts, custom formatting, advanced analytics

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Install Required Custom Cards

1. **Install HACS** (Home Assistant Community Store) if you haven't already
2. **Add Custom Repositories** in HACS:
   - Go to HACS ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí Add Repository
   - Add: `piitaya/lovelace-mushroom`
   - Add: `thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod`
   - For advanced graphs, also add: `kalkih/mini-graph-card`
3. **Install the Custom Cards** via HACS

### Step 2: Add Required Template Sensors

Add these template sensors to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: time_date
    display_options:
      - "time"
  - platform: template
    sensors:
      spa_pump_1_running_numeric:
        friendly_name: "Spa Pump 1 Running Numeric"
        unique_id: spa_pump_1_running_numeric_sensor
        unit_of_measurement: ""
        value_template: >-
          {% if is_state('binary_sensor.esphome_web_bb4e14_spa_pump_1_running', 'on') %}
            1
          {% else %}
            0
          {% endif %}
      
      spa_pump_2_speed_adjusted:
        friendly_name: "Spa Pump 2 Speed Adjusted"
        unique_id: spa_pump_2_speed_adjusted
        unit_of_measurement: ""
        value_template: >-
          {% set pump2_state = states('sensor.esphome_web_bb4e14_spa_pump_2_speed') | int(0) %}
          {% if pump2_state > 0 %}
            2
          {% else %}
            0
          {% endif %}
```

**Important**: Replace `esphome_web_bb4e14` with your actual device name.

### Step 3: Choose Your Dashboard

#### Option A: Simple Graphs (Recommended for Beginners)
```yaml
# Copy the contents of spa-dashboard-simple-graphs.yaml
# This uses built-in Home Assistant history graphs
```

#### Option B: Advanced Graphs (For Power Users)
```yaml
# Copy the contents of spa-dashboard-with-graphs.yaml
# This provides interactive charts with custom formatting
```

### Step 4: Apply the Dashboard

1. **Create a New Dashboard** in Home Assistant:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Dashboards ‚Üí Add Dashboard
   - Choose "YAML" mode
   - Paste the configuration from your chosen file

2. **Update Entity Names** (if needed):
   - Replace `esphome_web_bb4e14` with your actual device name
   - Check your entities in Developer Tools ‚Üí States

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Graphs Not Showing Data**:
   - Check that your entities are reporting data
   - Verify entity names match your configuration
   - Ensure Home Assistant is recording history

2. **Custom Cards Not Loading**:
   - Verify HACS installation
   - Check custom card installation in HACS
   - Clear browser cache and reload

3. **Entity Names Don't Match**:
   - Check your actual entity names in Developer Tools ‚Üí States
   - Update the dashboard configuration with correct names
   - Your device name will be different from `esphome_web_bb4e14`

4. **Pump Speed Values Showing Incorrectly**:
   - Ensure template sensors are properly configured
   - Check that `spa_pump_2_speed_adjusted` is converting values correctly
   - Verify the `state_map` configuration in mini-graph-cards

### Finding Your Entity Names

1. Go to **Developer Tools ‚Üí States** in Home Assistant
2. Search for your spa device name
3. Look for entities like:
   - `climate.your_device_name_spa_thermostat`
   - `sensor.your_device_name_spa_pump_1_speed`
   - `binary_sensor.your_device_name_filter_1_running`
